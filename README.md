Title: Collaborative Printf Project on GitHub

Description:

Welcome to our collaborative printf project on GitHub, In this exciting endeavor, we aim to utilize a set of authorized functions and macros to craft a robust and extensible printf function that can be a valuable tool for developers across various programming languages.

Project Objectives:
Our primary objective is to create a reliable and customizable printf functions that supports a wide range of formatting options and data types. By harnessing the power of C standard library functions and macros, our project intends to offer a highly efficient and feature-rich printf for developers working on C and related languages.

Authorized Functions and Macros:
We've carefully selected a set of authorized functions and macros to ensure that our project adheres to best practices and promotes code quality. These authorized functions and macros include:

project files:
_printf.c: imitate the printf function
print_address.c: handles the convertion of string hexi
print_all_converters.c: handles the convertion of a string in a specified base
print_bases.c: handles numbers in hexadecimal, binary base 2 and octal base 8
print_get_flag.c: handles flags of specified strings
print_get_print.c: handles printing function based on specifiers
print_non_custom.c: handles %, rot13, string reverse and bigS in hexadecimal
print_numbers.c: handles integers and unsigned integers
print_strings.c: handles the string and character function
write_function.c: handles the write function
