Title: Collaborative Printf Project on GitHub

Description:

Welcome to our collaborative printf project on GitHub, where a community of passionate developers is coming together to create a versatile and efficient printf implementation. In this exciting endeavor, we aim to utilize a set of authorized functions and macros to craft a robust and extensible printf function that can be a valuable tool for developers across various programming languages.

Project Objectives:
Our primary objective is to create a reliable and customizable printf function that supports a wide range of formatting options and data types. By harnessing the power of C standard library functions and macros, our project intends to offer a highly efficient and feature-rich printf for developers working on C and related languages.

Authorized Functions and Macros:
We've carefully selected a set of authorized functions and macros to ensure that our project adheres to best practices and promotes code quality. These authorized functions and macros include:

write (man 2 write): To facilitate the output of formatted data to the specified file descriptor.
malloc (man 3 malloc): For dynamic memory allocation to handle variable-sized output strings.
free (man 3 free): To release dynamically allocated memory and prevent memory leaks.
va_start (man 3 va_start): Used to initialize the variable argument list.
va_end (man 3 va_end): To indicate the end of variable argument processing.
va_copy (man 3 va_copy): Required for safe copying of variable argument lists.
va_arg (man 3 va_arg): Used to access the next argument in the variable argument list.
